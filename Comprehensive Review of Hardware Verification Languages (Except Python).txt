Comprehensive Review of Hardware Verification Languages (Except Python)

The Abstract

This section, “Comprehensive Review of Hardware Verification Languages (Except Python)” is part of the volume of “Verification IP & IP Core Verification” of the book family titled “Semiconductor IP Core – Not Just Design”.

This book investigates, treats and presents some of the key hardware description and verification languages involved in the verifications of ICs and in particular semiconductor Intellectual Property (IP) core design process, including the following chapters:

Hardware Verification Language – An Introduction
High-Level Verification Language (HVL)	
Verification Career – Choice of Languages	
SystemVerilog or System C: Industry Standard for Hardware Design and Verification?	
What Is The Difference Between E And Vera?
SystemVerilog	
Verilog	
VHDL	
E Hardware Verification Language & Specman	
SystemC	
C, C++	
Vera / Openvera	
ABC A System For Sequential Synthesis And Verification	
Dart	
Java	
Jeda	
Kami	
Maia	
Meta-Functional Languages for Hardware Verification	
Perl	
PSL Property Specification Language (Psl) / Sugar	
Portable Test And Stimulus (PSS)	
Ruby	
VLang	

Python is introduced in a separate book, considering its particular position in the verification business.

This 650+-page long introductory material will introduce readers to the major language packages and libraries dealing with the hardware verification needs, incl also prototyping, emulation and simulation. After reading, readers will become familiar with historic notes, key features, installation & configuration, usage, verification samples and results as well as their applications in the IC & IP Core verification sector. This is a comprehensive but introductory volume, for more detailed information, readers are advised to consult with the links and literature provided at the ends of each chapter. 

Unlike hardware design, the hardware verification, in theory, can be carried out in any languages – programming or hardware specific, therefore you can find almost all popular languages in the book, albeit some of them are less known and less used. Please read the book in the chapter order, because at time of writing this is the order of importance of their application and popularity for hardware verification.
