The Projects
==========

We have implemented various IC and IP core design and verification projects in the wireless communications, mainly in the areas of modulation and demodulation.

We have designed ICs and IP cores in various Hardware Design Languages (HDL) such as
VHDL
Verilog and its extentions and derivates
as well as generic computer languages such as
Python and Python packages
Java
C/C++ and others.

We have applied different design methodologies for those projects, including but not limited to:

ASIC
FPGA
SDR - Software Defined Radio
DSP - Digital Signal Processor
GPU
CPU
and a number of other technologies.

We have also conducted verifications in various technologies, tools and stages of the design from specification to physical design, with technology such as 
Formal verification
Functional verification.

Our verifications are carried out on different simulators, both free/open source and commercial.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies are also considered when carrying our design and verification, that is, when choosing EDAs for design and verification, we favor those with AI/ML algorithms to those without AI/ML.
