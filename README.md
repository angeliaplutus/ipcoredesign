Design and Verification of ICs and IP Cores

I have been a chip (IC) researcher and designer since 2013. I am particularly specialized in FPGA, DSP, SOC and RF design and I am also skilled at designing mixed analog and digital circuits. 

My current design focuses on IP cores for wireless communications and other applications.

Among them, my 1st priority is for satellite broadband Internet in the DVB standard series. I am working on modulators based in FPGA, HDL and others to cope with several modulation schemes such as BPSK, FSK, MSK, OQPSK, UQPSK and for DVB S2/S2X/RCS2 applications. The modem IPs are available as proprietorial IP products in the form of HDL codes or binary netlists, which can be integrated into modem blocks of other modem vendors. The IP cores can then be incorporated further into VLSI circuits of various terminals, indoor and outdoor units and modems on the ground. 

My 2nd priority is on Verification of IP Cores and ICs. One of the biggest challenges to the IC engineers is the verification of the designs, therefore I am spending huge amount of time and efforts on this area of specialty. 

Research and Writing about Design and Verification of IC and IP Cores
(Particularly Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning and Others) & Heuristics for Design Verification)

I am writing some of the important works and papers on the above topics and pretty soon you will see they are being announced on my websites. I am in process of authoring of the gigantic Book series titled “Semiconductor IP – Not just Design”, see http://www.ipcoredesign.net/html/000mybook/mybook.htm

Verification IP & IP Core Verification

I am authoring a huge volume of books containing all aspects of the verification processes - from methodologies to languages, from platforms to testing systems. 

Over the last year I’ve already completed several of the books in the area of Verification IP & IP Core Verification
within the book family such as:
Review of Verification IP & IP Core Verification – An Abstract
Verification Methodologies-A Concise Introduction
Comprehensive Review of Hardware Verification Languages (Except Python)
Hardware Verification in Python

Brief introductions are available on my website at the above links.

Mathematics for IC Design and Verification 
(with particular focus on Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning and Others) & Heuristics)

We’re in the AI age, therefore AI must also be among my competence for hardware design and verification. 

See my weblink:
http://www.ipcoredesign.net/html/000mybook/IP%20Core%20Mathematics/IP%20Core%20Mathematics.htm
This link gives you a first impression how ambitious it is with regards to my research and writing plan.

The following book is under preparation:
Math(AI ML) for Analog and Mixed Signal Verification
AI ML for Hardware Design, Verification & Manufacturing
AI ML for Hardware Verification
Hardware Verification for AMS Design
Hardware Verification Planning - A Concise Introduction
Hardware Verification Planning Tools

Research and Writing about Design of Quantum Computer

(Particularly Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning and Others) & Heuristics for Development and Design of  Quantum Computer)

We are also near a quantum age, therefore it’s time to dive into the Quantum Epoch with some of my math expertise, notable AI/ML, combinatorics and optimization.

A huge research, development and writing plan is in place. Currently one book and 1 paper are being prepared:
1) Math (AI & Heuristics) for Qubit Routing – A Survey
2) Qubit Routing with Machine Learning (Reinforcement Learning etc) 
The last will be research paper in an intention to develop a new algorithm in the direction of Machine Learning to improve the qubit routing efficiency.
