
Hardware Verification Planning - A Concise Introduction

The topics listed below are things I have considered over the last years during my implementation of several verification projects with my clients worldwide. Like anything else I have done or I am doing, I always write down all key points of the jobs and in the end they become a book of some sorts, that's why I have written hundreds of books amounting to tens of thousands of pages. But I have published none, for they are not written for publication or any other reasons. If I publish anything, that must be historic.

Verification is a huge topic, involving wide range of design, scientific and engineering fields. It's not a one-man business, insteat it requirs a great team to do some great jobs. 

Siemens has organized a verification academy, yes, we need an academy to research some of the most important areas of this critical process of the IC design. I cannot talk about all these topics in my books or essays, I can also not talk about all the topics listed below right now. They are of huge volume. 

If anyone is interested in any of the subjects below, or beyond, you may raise your questions to me here or through my websites. Or we can organize some special groups to talk about verification or some specific topics of the verification technologies.
