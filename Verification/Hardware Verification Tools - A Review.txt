
Hardware Verification Tools - A Review

My friends, I have collected a list of verification tools for both formal and functional verifications, as a result of my verification project implementation with several of my clients, for mostly AMS circuits in the RF and wireless communications applications. AMS stands for Analog and Mixed Signal, is defined as electronic circuits comprising of both analog and digital components. There are further categories as to which kind of components is of dominating roles to play, such as digital on top or analog on top or equally distributed.

The list is not complete, not without mistakes, but can probably give you a glimpse of how intensive are these tools in the work of hardware verification. It seems there are quite a lot of them, both free and commercial. I myself have tasted some of them, both free and paid ones. Some commercial tools are really bloody expensive, which I cannot afford to buy. There are some free and opensource tools which are really doing the job pretty well. 

Please be so kind as to tell me if this list gives you some useful information about the tools we can use for our verification jobs, which you are using right now, and what are their pros and cons. I don't have a complete review yet, but I do have some information about most of these tools, and the data are being updated along with my verification career.

Here below is the collection. They are divided into three categories, Formal, Functional and Cadence Special, because the last is of so much importance that it deserves a special chapter.
