Website for the Latest Information of the World's IC Technology & Industry
===========================================================================

I am developing a portal for the IC industry. Its aim is to provide users access to all key development on the research, development, design and manufacturing of IC technologies. Following contents will be covered:

Research on basic IC theory - research results of major universities and research institutions (including research institutions affiliated to large companies) in the world;
Chip design: new chip design theory, algorithm, language, model, software (EDA) and platforms, new chip design results, including IP cores;
Chip product development: prototype development, testing and trial production (before mass production);
Chip manufacturing: new manufacturing technologies and new technology nodes (including main processes, materials, processes, equipment, and software).

Users can get the latest technical information on this website. At present, the basic framework and codes of the website are basically completed, and parts of the contents are also published.

There is no similar website in the world.

In addition, the website has set up a special database about modem IP cores, and users can browse the basic information of the main modem IP cores, which is the introduction of the main contents of these IP cores. The main reason for designing such content is that I am specialized in design of modem IP cores, so I pay special attention to this part of the technology.

The other part of the website is to introduce the book about IP core design that I am writing now, in English, with the title "Silicon IP-More than just Design". The main reason for the slow progress in writing is that there is too much work to do:right now developing and maintaining websites, designing IP cores, writing reports on IC technologies, business contacts etc.

The website also introduces the "Monthly Report on World IC Technology Progress" being compiled by me as well.

The website has also designed a forum or blog, whatever you'd like to name it, waiting for you to settle in and publish your opinions.

There are also search functions, surveys, and user registration and user profile administration, and sections where there is a uploading of your own news (the progress of your company’s chip technology). The functionalities of the website will gradually be enriched and improved as the development goes ahead

If you are interested in participating in the website project, please feel free to contact me. You may invest in it, or promote the website somehow. However, the contents of the website are currently only in English and are geared towards English-speaking people. Whether the Chinese version will be added in the future depends on the situation. And the website cannot be accessed by domestic users for some reason.

My goal is to build the best network platform to introduce the world's chip technology progress. If you want to understand the chip technology, you only need to go to this platform, nothing more.
