Standards and Protocols

When designing modem (modulator and demodulator), the first thing you have to think about is the standards and protocols your modem shall work with, because different standards need different system configuration and data formats. In my case, I am interested in wireless communications, in particular satellite broadband Internet, therefore I have made some investigations in every possible protocols and standards in the industry, see the lsiting below. Of course I am not able to carefully study all of these standards, therefore I have been concentrating on a few of them, notably DVB, RFID, WLAN, 5G, and a couple of others. The list is incomplete as I have found out some of the familiar ones are missing. Don't care about that, because the evolution is so fast, any such similar listing is in no way complete.
