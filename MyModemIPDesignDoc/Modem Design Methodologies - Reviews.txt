Modem Design Methodologies

There are always millions of ways to do the same job, no exception to IC and IP core design.

For example for satellite and general modem (modulator + demodulator) design, I have studied the following possibilities of technology screening. Which ones to choose, completely depends on your project target and resources at your hand, and don't forget the time-to-market and cost considerations.
