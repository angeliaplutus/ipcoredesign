Book titled “Silicon IP – More than just Design”
====================================================
This book or rather a platform, a knowledge center, an information hub or an interactive venue on the Internet is being prepared along with my design work. It contains all aspects of the IP core business, industry, technology as well as design process. It will become a book in huge volume - perhaps thousands of pages in A4 size, possibly web based and forever-updated (in the area of IP Core) with an interim title of "Silicon IP – More than just Design". The topic will go far beyond just the design aspect of the IP industry, and it will eventually all major sectors of this business. I will publish a small part of it in document formats such as Word or PDF, and also a small part of it will be made available at my website. But if you want more, you need pay for them.
